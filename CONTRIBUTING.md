## How to contribute

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting code

1 - Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arturfigueira/node-ts-template.git
cd node-ts-template
```

2 - Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Also stick to these basic rules:

- One change per PR: Pull-requests should be small and easy to read. Do not mix different subjects, fixes, features;
- Add unit tests to cover your changes;
- To save your time, run tests locally and guarantee that it builds;
- Remove unnecessary files; [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) is pretty complete, and will cover almost any unnecessary file type, but it's not bullet proof.
